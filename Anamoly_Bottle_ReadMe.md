# select ok or nok image from /home/grajebhosle/Anomalib_main/tools/inference/Data folder 
# give threshold parameter for for ok image 
# threshold parameter not applied for anamoly prediction beacuase anomaly is only anomaly for us

# Download Weight folder and put it inside tools/inference folder for prediction 
# run python3 tools/inference/main.py indipendantly for multiple images basically we have to pass the folder path insdie for prediction on multiple images
